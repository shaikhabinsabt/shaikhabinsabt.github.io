			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I explore the hidden beauty in industrial and disaster-prone sites such as oil refineries, emphasizing contradictions and 			overlooked aesthetics. My process integrates CNC milling, resin casting, and laser cutting to create tactile architectural 			models and artifacts that challenge traditional perceptions.</p>

			<h2>Selected Projects</h2>

			<img src="" />
			<p>Abstract Refinery Model: A detailed CNC-milled model exploring the formal beauty of an oil refinery’s structural 				complexity.</p>
			<img src="" />
			<p>Resin Casting Artifact: Using resin to capture textures and forms inspired by disaster-affected materials, blending 				organic and industrial aesthetics.</p>
			<img src="" />
			<p>Laser-Cut Architectural Study: Laser-cut layered explorations highlighting fragmentation and reconstruction in industrial 			landscapes.</p>
